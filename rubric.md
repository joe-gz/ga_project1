# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations** Your commit history is thorough, with useful commit messages. Your wireframe folder is fantastic, and that kind of planning will continue to serve you well as your projects get more complex and ambitious in scope. Your readme is detailed and informative -- the only thing missing is installation instructions.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations** Three gameplay modes, plus color options, plus three decks -- wow! I didn't run into any major bugs while playing your game. Really well done, Joe!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations** Your semantic naming makes this less of an issue, but you could definitely comment your code more thoroughly. An object-oriented approach would help make your code DRY-er, but the approach you've taken is totally appropriate for this point in the course.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** Yes! Not much to say, really. Your approach to problem solving is well documented through everything discussed above. Rock on.
